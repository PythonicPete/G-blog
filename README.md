🌐 G-Blogs: The Social Travel Ecosystem

A Production-Grade Django Platform

</div>

🔥 Introduction

G-Blogs is not just another social media clone; it is a sophisticated, full-stack web application engineered for travelers and storytellers. It bridges the gap between the instant gratification of Instagram and the structured networking of LinkedIn.

From real-time interactions without page reloads to a complex Visa Journey tracking system, every feature has been hand-coded to provide a seamless, "FAANG-level" user experience.

💎 Core Experience

1. The "Explore" Engine 🔍

A reimagined search experience that feels instant and fluid.

Zero-Latency Search: As you type, results for both People and Posts appear instantly via AJAX, with no page reloads.

Smart Discovery: When the search bar is empty, an intelligent "Explore Grid" showcases trending content in a beautiful, responsive mosaic layout.

Visual Design: Featuring a glassmorphism search bar and hover-reveal user cards.

2. Immersive Social Feed 📱

Split-Screen Detail View: Clicking a post opens a dedicated "Theater Mode" — media on the left, scrolling conversation on the right.

Instant Engagement: Like and Comment actions happen in real-time.

Rich Media Support: Seamless handling of high-res images and auto-playing videos.

3. The Visa Journey System (Unique Feature) ✈️

A specialized feature for global travelers.

Digital Passport: Users can select visas they have earned from a master database.

Storytelling: Each selected visa opens a dedicated Journey Modal, allowing the user to share the specific story of how they obtained it.

Visual Logic: Selected visas appear as a horizontal scrolling showcase on the profile, complete with status indicators.

4. Fortified Identity System 🔐

Custom Auth: Email-first login system replacing legacy usernames.

Security: Integrated SMTP email verification and secure password recovery flows.

One-Click Onboarding: Google OAuth2 social login integration.
